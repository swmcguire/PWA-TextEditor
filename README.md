# PWA-TextEditor
Your task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
## Description

The PWA text editor is essentially a notepad that can store data in the local browser - when you leave the page and come back the data persists and repopulates

The notepad can be downloaded and the data will persist online as well as offline.

The project was relatively straightforward, there were a couple sticking points but overall very helpful and a good time to work through.
